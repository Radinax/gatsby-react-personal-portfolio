# My Personal Portfolio made with Gatsby.

## Quick Start

yarn install

# Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible at localhost:8000
gatsby develop 

# Gatsby will perform an optimized production build for your site generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles.

## Why I choose Gatbsy for this project?

Since I'm working on becoming a React developer I wanted to make use of this Library to create my personal portfolio, but it seemed overkill for a simple one page site, so here is where Gatbsy comes, it makes blazing fast static websites (has options for the backend) with the support of Graphql and most importantly React. As it can be seen, the website is made of components which are their own world without the use of a CSS Framework but using Styled-Components which mesh well with the concept of React of making independent reusable components.

## Closure

This was a great and fun experience personally, using Gatsby is such a pleasure and it makes both the developer and the client happy because of the speed of the website you can create.
